The service API of osmdroid is not finished yet. There are several possibilities to achieve the separation of tile storage & retrieval and an app. Here is a comparison:

<table cellspacing="20"><tr><td>
== Passing bitmap objects ==

The bitmap goes through the following steps until it is displayed:

*Service:*
 * download or load from SD-card
 * decode bitmap format (JPG, PNG)
 * pass bitmap object

*Activity:*
 * get bitmap object from service
 * draw to screen

*Pro:*
 * Could be faster (SD-card needs not to be accessed in case of download)
 * Storage on SD-card is transparent (can be ZIP-files or database or whatever)

</td><td>
== Passing file paths ==

The bitmap goes through the following steps until it is displayed:

*Service:*
 * download
 * store to SD-card
 * pass file path

*Activity:*
 * get file path from service
 * load from SD-card
 * decode bitmap format (JPG, PNG)
 * draw to screen

*Pro:*
 * No need to pass large objects between service and activity
