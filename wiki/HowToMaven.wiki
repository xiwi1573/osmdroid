#summary How to use in Maven projects and how to build osmdroid using Maven.

= Introduction =

This document is a begin of some documentation.  Still very much in progress.  See issue 199.


= How to use osmdroid in your Maven project =

If your project already uses Maven and you want to include osmdroid then it's as simple as

{{{
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.osmdroid</groupId>
  <artifactId>osmdroid-android</artifactId>
  <version>3.0.8</version>
</dependency>
}}}


= How to use osmdroid in your non-Maven project =

If you are not yet using Maven you can include osmdroid by downloading from the link on the home page or directly from [https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/org/osmdroid/ Maven Central] and then include the jar in your libs folder.

Some basic steps:

 # Install Maven http://maven.apache.org/download.html
 # Install Maven support in Eclipse. Add http://download.eclipse.org/technology/m2e/releases as a software install repo and install the m2e support package. Can also be installed from Eclipse Marketplace.
 # Install Android configurator for Maven from Eclipse Marketplace.
 # Download the osmdroid source from subversion to a local folder. If you want to download within Maven, you will need to install a 3rd party svn plugin from http://subclipse.tigris.org/m2eclipse/1.0/
 # In Eclipse Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven project. Import osmdroid.
 # Download Android SDK dependency using Android SDK Deployer https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer  Follow instructions to deploy android sdk package to local repository. You may need to delete and reinstall parts of the SDK if it cannot find the correct folder names (apparently the SDK changed the names of some folders and you may still have them named under the old folder names).
 # Right click on osmdroid-parent project. Click Maven->Update Project and make sure all projects are checked. Click OK.

The project should then build successfully.
